# 1PYTH final project

This project was made by me to validate the Python unit.
The goal was to make 2 boards games in Python language.

## Nimble

` The goal of this game is to put every pieces on the first case, the last player to put his piece on the first case win. `

## Lewthwaite's game

`The goal of this game is to block your enemie; The winner is the player who can move his piece.`
